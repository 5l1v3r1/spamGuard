Q: Although the e-mail address is in my ignore file, spamguard still adds this
   address to the badmailfrom file, is there a bug?


A: [for spamGuard Vs. >= 1.7] This behaviour has been changed in release 1.7.
   The e-mail address is in ignore file never be blocked. The new config file
   "highfile" will be used to block the addressed send mail more than pcnt
   value.

   [for old versions] No, it's not a bug, it's a feature. As explained in the
   README, there are three threshold values:

   If someone sends less mails than warning value, he's simply discarded,

   If someone sends more mails than warning value, less than block, he's not
   blocked, but a warning mail is sent to the sysadmin.

   If someone sends more mails than block value and less than paranoid value, 
   the address is checked against ignore list and badmailfrom, if the
   address is existent on the lists, it's not blocked, if not it's added to
   the badmailfrom file.

   If someone sends even more mails than paranoid value, it's checked against
   badmailfrom to see whether this address has been added to it before. Note
   that the address is not checked against ignore file here. Paranoid mode
   means "I don't care whether he's in my ignore list, if he sends this much
   mails, nuke the blooddy spammer!".

   So, you do have a chance to specify paranoid threshold to a very high value,
   say 1000000, if you don't want the "paranoid functionality".
