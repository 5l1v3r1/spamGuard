Making and Installing EnderUNIX spamGuard v.1.8
====================================================================

This file provides brief instructions on how to build and install
spamGuard on UNIX (and UNIX-like) system.  More detailed information
and instructions can be found in EnderUNIX website:
(http://www.enderunix.org/spamguard/).

It is recommended that you read, or at least skim through, ALL of
the instructions in this file before attempting to build the software.


Making and Installing 
-----------------------------------------------

1.   Unpack the software and change directory as root:

	# tar -zxfz spamguard-VERSION.tar.gz 
	# cd spamguard-VERSION

2.   # ./autogen.sh

3.   # ./configure 

4.   Type:

     # make

     If all goes well, all binaries will be compiled.

5.   Install the binary.  

     # make install

     Binary will be installed in /usr/local/bin.
     A sample spamguard.conf will be installed in /usr/local/etc/spamguard.
     
6.   Copy spamguard.conf.sample to some path to your liking.
     Note that if you specify some other location than /usr/local/etc/spamguard,
     you'll need to supply path to spamguard.conf via the -f swicth
     at run time.

     Parameters in spamguard.conf file:

	logtype = "qmail"
		Your log type. Possible values are: qmail, qsheff,
		sendmail, postfix

	logfile = "/var/log/qmail/current"
		Location of your log file.

		An important thing to note here is that; keep the
		size of your log file large.  If you're using qmail
		with multilog, you can set this in the qmail-send/log/run
		file with the s (size) parameter like this: (all
		in one line) 

		#!/bin/sh 
                exec /usr/local/bin/setuidgid  \
		qmaill /usr/local/bin/multilog  t s5000000 \
		/var/log/qmail

		if you're using syslog, change the rotate size.

	ignorefile = "/usr/local/etc/spam-ignore.txt" #
		Location of your ignore file. Ignore file will hold
		the addresses to ignored by spamguard.

	highfile = "/usr/local/etc/spam-high.txt" 
		the addresses in this file  will be added in badmail file 
		when they sent mail more than pcnt value

	badmailfile = "/var/qmail/control/badmailfrom"
		Your MTA's blacklist'ed senders file.  If you're
		using qmail most probably this will be:
		/var/qmail/control/badmailfrom;

                if sendmail : 
		/etc/mail/access; 
               
		if postfix it'll be
		/usr/local/etc/postfix/access

	sysadmin = "spam-notify@somedomain.com"
		The person who will receive spammer activity reports.

	hostname = "enderunix.org"
		If no hostname is found in the sender line, this
		will be appended to the username. 
                e.g from= <root> will be from = <root@hostname>.

	mail_command = "/usr/bin/mail"
		Where's your mail/mailx binary.  Solaris users
		should use mailx instead of mail.


	makemap_command = "makemap hash /etc/mail/access </etc/mail/access"
		For Postfix and Sendmail users only.

	statfile = "/usr/local/etc/spamguard.stat";
		Stat file. Internal use.

	wcnt = 40
		Warning threshold.

	bcnt = 50
		Block threshold

	pcnt = 100
		Paranoid threshold.

	enable_subj_filt = 0
		These lines are for qSheff configuration. If qSheff does not installed on your system,
                please disable subject filtering by assigning 0 to enable_subj_filt value. If 1 is
                assigned to enable_subj_filt value, then subject filtering will be enabled (subjects
                will NOT be trimmed). If there are strings, such as [!! SPAM], [?? Probable Spam],
                [!!! VIRUS], which are appended front of subjects, then make enable_subj_filt
                value 2 to enabling subject trimming. Subjects will be added as rules to qsheff.rules file
		after trimmed according to strings included in trim_subj_str.

	qsheff_rules_file = "/usr/local/etc/qsheff-II/qsheff.rules"
		If enable_subj_filt value equals to 0, do not care this option. If subject filtering is
		enabled (enable_subj_filt is equal to 1 or 2), then this path will be used for adding new
		rules to qsheff.rules file.

	trim_subj_str = "[!! SPAM] ,[?? Probable Spam] ,[!!! VIRUS] ";
                If enable_subj_filt value equals to 0 or 1, do not care this option. If enable_subj_filt
		value is 2, then strings included by trim_subj_str will be cutted from subjects. Please
		pay attention to this: the strings must be seperated by a comma. For instance: the 1st string
		is "[!! SPAM] ", the 2nd string is "[?? Probable Spam] ", and the last one is "[!!! VIRUS] ".
		It's hope that you cared about the blank characters.

7.   That's it!
     Now, read POST-INSTALL document for instructions after
     installation.
