		spamGuard 1.9 README
	---------------------------------------

Nearly all of today's mail system administrators face spam as their
first threat. Because of this, EnderUNIX team has written this small
application to automagically monitor malicious spammer activity in
your mail server logs.

spamGuard is written purely in C, to stop spammers hanging around.
The program supports nearly all mostly used MTAs; qmail (qSheff,
multilog, and splogger), sendmail, Postfix and Exim.

Rationale: 
----------

1. spamGuard is fired via crontab within fixed intervals. 
2. spamGuard scans the accumulated maillog and finds the amount of
mails users sent.
3. spamGuard loads its ignore list from its
   ignore file and badmailfiles files(badmailfrom in
   qmail and access for sendmail).
4. users whose mail count exceeds the configured threshold value(there
   are three different values: warning, block and paranoid) are treated 
   as spammers. They are added to mailers' badmail file (spammer 
   blacklist files).
5. Notification mails are sent to sysadmins about spammer activity,
   if present. 
6. (For sendmail version, a hash database of access
   file is created).

spamGuard can process a 85 MB log file in less then 10 seconds.

Tested on: FreeBSD 4-STABLE Solaris 2.7-Sparc
